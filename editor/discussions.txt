Consider possible multi-client issues. What unexpected/undesired behaviors are possible? Can you actually make any of them happen?
Where and why do you use synchronized methods; will they handle everything? Write a short (approximately a paragraph) response.

Multi-client issues can arise such as inconsistent state updates, integrity of data packets lost and many more.
If multiple clients attempt to modify or delete the same shape simultaneously, one client's update could
overwrite another client without synchronization. Therefore, synchronization helps for one client to make changes before the other,
using the locking mechanism for threads. Some other issues such as delayed network can cause one client to receive outdated
sketches which may result to inconsistencies across editors.
