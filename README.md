# Collaborative Sketch Editor

A simple client-server graphical editor that allows multiple users to collaboratively draw, move, recolor, and delete shapes in real-time. The project is built using Java Swing for the GUI and an Echo Server for communication.

## Features
- **Drawing Mode**: Supports ellipse, rectangle, freehand, and line segment drawing.
- **Move Mode**: Allows users to reposition existing shapes.
- **Recolor Mode**: Enables changing the color of selected shapes.
- **Delete Mode**: Removes unwanted shapes from the canvas.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple clients can connect and modify the same sketch.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A terminal or command prompt

## Running the Project

### 1. Start the Server
Before launching the editor, you must start the Echo Server to handle client connections.

## Initiate Project
- javac EchoServer.java
- java EchoServer <port>

- javac Editor.java
- java Editor <serverIP> <port>

## Connect Multiple Users
	•	Each user should connect using java Editor <serverIP> <port>.
	•	All connected users will see and interact with the same sketch.

## Future Improvements
	•	Implement a more efficient networking protocol.
	•	Add an undo/redo functionality.
	•	Improve user authentication and access control.
